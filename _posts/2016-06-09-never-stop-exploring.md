Recently I attended [Meet Magento NL 2016](https://www.meet-magento.nl/) and it
was my first time in the Netherlands.

One of the things that impressed me was the "exploring spirit" of Dutch people.

I had that feeling since I landed at Amsterdam Shiphol airport and it was
confirmed as soon as I arrived at my host's apartment where there were plenty of
books, wall writings and pictures about never stopping exploring.

And that's why I decided to give my new technical blog the title it has, because
it represents my attitude towards technology and life in general.

In this blog I will collect my day by day discoverings about Magento and related
technologies.

Enjoy!

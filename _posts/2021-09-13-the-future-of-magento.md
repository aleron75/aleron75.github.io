## Foreword
Magento has been the dominant **open-source** eCommerce platform for a decade. Its **community** is an unparalleled one, and part of the success and innovation of the product is undoubtedly due to it.

Magento, now Adobe Commerce, is heading towards a SaaS solution, a composition of microservices orchestrated with the Adobe I/O platform.

## A new alliance
Given that Adobe is in its full right to evolve Magento to serve its primary customer targeted group, many people still do business around the open-source monolith. 

To preserve Magento's long-term viability for all companies and merchants depending on it, we gave birth to **a new alliance**.

## The open letter to the Magento Community
You can have more details about the mission of the alliance by reading [the open letter to the Magento Community](https://www.mage-os.community/blog/the-future-of-magento) that we have published.

If you want to show your endorsement and be informed of future updates publicly, you are invited to sign the open letter.

Stay tuned!
